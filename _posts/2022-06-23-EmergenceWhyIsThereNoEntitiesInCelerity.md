Entity is the first of the three core principles of ECS design pattern. Nevertheless, I've decided that there should be
no entities in [Emergence](https://github.com/KonstantinTomashevich/Emergence) ECS-like framework Celerity.
I will tell you how I've arrived at this decision in this post.

### ECS pattern

For those who are not familiar with the Entity-Component-System pattern I have decided to write a quick recap.

Historically, ECS is the evolution of the [Components](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/component.html) pattern,
in which the parts of the game world, usually called game objects or actors, can receive additional features through
the addition of components with custom logic. This pattern has saved quite a few projects from the drawbacks of the malicious
"just write the game logic and use inheritance" pattern, used extensively in the old days. That's the reason why
[Components](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/component.html) is a core feature of both well-known engines, like
Unity and Unreal Engine, and less known ones, like Urho3D.

But [Components](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/component.html) pattern didn't solve all the pitfalls of its
predecessor, and one of the most malicious problems was the update order. When every object and every component
chaotically subscribes to update the routine, it is not only difficult to know whether it uses the current frame or the previous
frame state of the other objects, but also nearly impossible to track what happens during the game loop. This kind of chaos
is a problem by itself, but it leads to another problem too: how to make the gameplay logic parallel when everything is
so chaotic and uncontrollable?

That's where Entity-Component-System comes to the rescue by removing all the logic from the components and returning
to the times of procedural programming. Sounds too dramatic and old-fashioned? Maybe, but it has really helped to
sort things out, so let's describe what it is by first describing 3 core pillars of ECS:

- **Entity**: it is something that exists inside the game world. It might be a tree, a player, an
  invisible controller. But the entity by itself has no logic at all, it is just a collection of components! Nothing more,
  nothing less.

- **Component**: it is just a collection of data, possibly even a plain-old-data structure. Ideally, components have
  no logic at all, just a data layout. But sometimes there are utility functions that help access data or modify it
  without breaking the coherency.

- **System**: it is a place to put the game logic into. It might be a function or something more sophisticated. The core
  rule is that all meaningful logic should be placed inside systems, and the systems themselves depend on each other to make
  the update order predictable.

So, what problems does this pattern solve?

- Update order is always predictable due to the dependencies between the systems that contain all the logic.
- It is much easier to make the logic parallel, because systems access well-known sets of components, so we can
  just execute them simultaneously if they do not both modify the same component type.
- It is much easier to serialize data and send it over the network, because the logic is separated from the data.

Now you know what ECS theoretically is, so we can discuss the topic of entities deeper.

### What is an Entity?

Many old-school developers still think of entities as game objects without logic: just the game objects that store
multiple components. It is not incorrect to think like that, but in my opinion it hides the storage-management
aspect of ECS by simply treating entities as vectors.

Modern approaches usually treat entities as just numbers. Yes, simple numbers that are used to query components
from their component storages. For example, we can have a separate memory pool for each component type, so that the access
to several components of the same type will be much more cache coherent. Of course, it is not the only "correct"
way to treat the entity concept: there are things like entity family locality optimizations, but I won't dig further
into that topic in this post as I'm not an expert in that.

But let's dig deeper into the "entity as number" idea. Doesn't it remind you of some other topics from computer
science? Like foreign indices from relational databases? The thing is that we can view component types as tables
and entities as foreign keys that create relations between components. I like to draw parallels between different
computer science topics, and therefore I really like this connection: it looks like a powerful path to improve
ECS pattern even further by adding an ability to create other indices instead of only querying by the entity id.
It is not a fresh idea, but I've never seen any successful implementations of that principle, therefore I have decided
that I must try to implement it myself.

### How the additional indexing helps?

At first glance additional indices might sound excessive. Why do we need them after all if everything worked fine
without them? But I'm convinced that there are enough cases to justify that we need them:

- In some projects there are a lot of so-called flag components, like `AliveComponent`, `ReadyToSpawnComponent`, etc.
  These components have no data and are only used to filter entities. But if we were able to create additional indices,
  we wouldn't need these components anymore: we could just store this data as fields, like `bool alive`, and create
  indices for these fields. Feel the need to iterate over all the alive units? Just use a query on this index.

- I've seen a lot of expressions like `if (timeNow < component->coolingDownUntil) continue;`. It's not only bad for
  the performance, but also decreases readability by adding checks like this everywhere. But why not create a sorted index
  on `coolingDownUntil`? It would allow us to get the cooled down entities fast and without the iterate-over-everything
  overhead. And because the cool down is not really applied every frame, the index usage overhead will be really tiny.

- Almost always there are some so-called managers that accompany the game world. For example, `ConfigManager` or
  `WeaponStatsManager`. Usually, these managers work as glorified hash maps, which made me think: why not put
  their data as additional tables inside the game world? We can use the same API to create indices over configs and stats
  ids and to get rid of excessive managers.

### Game world as a universal storage

By allowing users to create additional tables and indices for whatever they need, we convert the game world into some
kind of universal storage. We can store a lot of things there:

- Components, first and foremost.
- Records with a short lifetime, like events. Just don't index them. :)
- Singletons.
- Configs.
- Stats.
- Maybe even assets!

It might sound messy, but it also sounds really powerful, isn't it? At least it is for me, therefore I decided to
make it the core idea for my ECS implementation. Sticking to this idea makes the principle of entities obsolete:
we just have tables with records and systems (personally, I prefer to call them tasks) that operate on these records.

Of course, this approach has its pros and cons. Let's start from pros:

- User can store everything in the game world and treat all the data in the same way.
- Indices can be created for whatever user needs without restrictions.

And there are cons:

- Entity family optimizations can not be applied here, because there are no entities.
- It might be difficult to navigate in storage, because it will store almost everything.

For me, pros outweigh the cons, but you're free to argue about it.

In the end, I'd like to share some examples from my unfinished demo to show how this works.

#### Inserting physical material into the world

```c++
// Tasks (systems) store prepared queries as fields. This query allows user to insert records.
Emergence::Celerity::InsertLongTermQuery insertDynamicsMaterial;
// ...

/// Task initialize queries in constructors.
: insertDynamicsMaterial (INSERT_LONG_TERM (Emergence::Physics::DynamicsMaterial)),
// ...

// Then we can insert materials using this query during task execution.
auto materialCursor = insertDynamicsMaterial.Execute ();
auto *material = static_cast<Emergence::Physics::DynamicsMaterial *> (++materialCursor);

material->id = PhysicsConstant::DEFAULT_MATERIAL_ID;
material->staticFriction = 0.4f;
material->dynamicFriction = 0.4f;
material->enableFriction = true;
material->restitution = 0.3f;
material->density = 400.0f;
```

#### Querying by an entity (object) id

```c++
// This query allows user to gain read-only access to all records with
// requested value in given field.
Emergence::Celerity::FetchValueQuery fetchShapeByObjectId;
// ...

: fetchShapeByObjectId (FETCH_VALUE_1F (CollisionShapeComponent, objectId)),
// ...

// Process all shapes on object using prepared query and cycle.
for (auto shapeCursor = fetchShapeByObjectId.Execute (&objectId);
     const auto *shape = static_cast<const CollisionShapeComponent *> (*shapeCursor); ++shapeCursor)
{
    // ...
}
```

#### Querying cooled down components

```c++
// This query allows user to gain full write access to all records
// where field value is inside given interval.
Emergence::Celerity::ModifyAscendingRangeQuery modifyShootersByCoolingDownUntil;
// ...

: modifyShootersByCoolingDownUntil (MODIFY_ASCENDING_RANGE (ShooterComponent, coolingDownUntilNs)),
/// ...

// Process all the shooters where the cool down ended before this moment.
// `nullptr` as query argument represents negative (if first) or positive (if second) infinity.
for (auto shooterCursor = modifyShootersByCoolingDownUntil.Execute (nullptr, &time->fixedTimeNs);
     auto *shooter = static_cast<ShooterComponent *> (*shooterCursor);)
{
    // ...
}
```

That's all for now. Hope you've enjoyed reading! :)

### Bio

I'm game developer by calling rather than by choice. I'm in love with games since my childhood and always dreamt of 
developing my own! As an incurable perfectionist, I always strive to implement impossibly ideal technical solutions. 
Not without lots of failures, of course. :)

### Why is this blog called like that?

I've been thinking about blogging a long time, but I finally decided to start doing it after drinking several vodka and 
rum based coctails. So, what else could I call this blog after that? If you got the reference, here are your bonus karma 
points and major sanity debuff (what else have you expected, after all?).

### About author

I'm a game developer by vocation rather than by choice.
I have been in love with games since my childhood and have always been dreaming of developing my own!
As an incurable perfectionist as I always strive for implementing impossibly ideal technical solutions.
Not without lots of failures, of course. :)

### About this blog

I've started this blog because I want to share my programming expertise with more people.
Code runs in my veins, so it is important for me to share what's going on with my projects.
I plan on writing different kinds of posts:

- Emergence Development Log: Everything about [Emergence](https://github.com/KonstantinTomashevich/Emergence) project
  development.
- Emergence tutorials: Tutorials on how to work with [Emergence](https://github.com/KonstantinTomashevich/Emergence)
  libraries once they're ready, of course. :)
- Hints: Small notes about different aspects of programming.
- Arrow to the Knee: name speaks for itself, I guess. These notes will be about shooting yourself with your code.
- There might be articles and tutorials on general topics connected to game development, but I'm not sure yet.

### Why is this blog named like that?

I've been thinking about blogging a long time, and I've finally decided to start after drinking several vodka and
rum based cocktails.
So, what else could I name this blog?
If you got the reference, here are your bonus karma points and major sanity debuff
(what else did you expect, after all?).

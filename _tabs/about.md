### About author

I'm game developer by calling rather than by choice.
I'm in love with games since my childhood and always dreamt of developing my own! 
As an incurable perfectionist, I always strive to implement impossibly ideal technical solutions. 
Not without lots of failures, of course. :)

### About this blog

I've started this blog because I wan't to share my experience and information about my projects with more people.
Code runs through my veins, so it is important for me share what's going on with my code and my projects. 
I plan to write different kinds of posts:

- Emergence Development Log: Everything about [Emergence](https://github.com/KonstantinTomashevich/Emergence) project
  development.
- Emergence tutorials: Tutorials about how to work with [Emergence](https://github.com/KonstantinTomashevich/Emergence)
  libraries once they're ready, of course. :)
- Hints: Small notes about different aspects of programming.
- Arrow to the Knee: name speaks for itself, I guess. These notes will be about shooting yourself with your code.
- There might be articles and tutorials about general topics, connected to game development, but I'm not sure yet.

### Why is this blog called like that?

I've been thinking about blogging a long time, but I finally decided to start doing it after drinking several vodka and 
rum based coctails. 
So, what else could I call this blog after that? 
If you got the reference, here are your bonus karma points and major sanity debuff 
(what else have you expected, after all?).
